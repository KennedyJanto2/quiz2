                  •The grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly.

    -branch 1: search-multiple-function:
    
               employeeOne.c Complete searching the table for the other entries by creating search functions for the other two entries. 
               Search by number and name have already been completed. Complete search by phone number and salary.   
               Show example of a match and no match in each of your functions. Hence 4 cases total ->Update employeeMain.c
    -branch 2: single-search-pass-function:
    
               employeeTwo.c – Complete searching the table for other entries by passing in the function that will perform the search. 
               (Make sure employeeOne.c is not located in this branch.) 
               NOTE: employeeMain.c should be the same for both of the implementations above.
